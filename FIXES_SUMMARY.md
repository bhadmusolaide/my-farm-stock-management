  - Storage Information (location, status, expiry)
  - Parts Breakdown (detailed parts table)
  - Notes
- Color-coded yield rate (warning for <95%, success for >=95%)
- Formatted dates and numbers
- Responsive grid layout

#### 2. Updated `src/components/DressedChicken/DressedChicken.css`

  - `.processing-details` - main container
  - `.details-section` - section containers
  - `.details-grid` - responsive grid layout
  - `.detail-item` - individual detail items
  - `.parts-table` - parts breakdown table

- **Fixed lifecycle sync issue**: Updated filter to accept both relationship types:
  - `'partial_processed_from'` (from manual processing)
  - `'processed_from'` (from lifecycle tracking)

#### 5. Verified `src/pages/ChickenLifecycle.jsx`
- Confirmed lifecycle tracking properly creates dressed chicken records
- Verified batch relationships are created with correct data
- Confirmed progression from processing stage creates records in dressed chicken inventory

### Result
