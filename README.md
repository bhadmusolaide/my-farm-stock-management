## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd chicken-stock-react
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Database Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the SQL schema from `schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor
3. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### 5. Create Admin User
Since the app doesn't have public registration, create your first admin user:

**Option A: Direct Database Insert**
```sql
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, password_hash, full_name, role, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (
  'admin-' || extract(epoch from now()),
  'admin@yourcompany.com',
  'temp_password_hash',
  'System Administrator',
  'admin',
  true,
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

Then set up Supabase Auth for this user in your Supabase Dashboard.

### 6. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to access the application.

## 🏗️ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.
