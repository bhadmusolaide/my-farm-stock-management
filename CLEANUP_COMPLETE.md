1. **src/pages/ChickenOrders.jsx** (1,459 lines)
   - Replaced with: `ChickenOrdersRefactored.jsx` (431 lines)
   - **Reduction: 70%** (1,028 lines removed)

2. **src/pages/LiveChickenStock.jsx** (1,644 lines)
   - Replaced with: `LiveChickenStockRefactored.jsx` (~350 lines)
   - **Reduction: 79%** (1,294 lines removed)

3. **src/pages/FeedManagement.jsx** (1,359 lines)

## Files Updated

### src/App.jsx

Updated lazy imports to use refactored versions:

```javascript
// Before
const ChickenOrders = lazy(() => import('./pages/ChickenOrders'))
const LiveChickenStock = lazy(() => import('./pages/LiveChickenStock'))
const FeedManagement = lazy(() => import('./pages/FeedManagement'))
const Reports = lazy(() => import('./pages/Reports'))
const DressedChickenStock = lazy(() => import('./pages/DressedChickenStock'))

// After
const ChickenOrders = lazy(() => import('./pages/ChickenOrdersRefactored'))
const LiveChickenStock = lazy(() => import('./pages/LiveChickenStockRefactored'))
const FeedManagement = lazy(() => import('./pages/FeedManagementRefactored'))
const Reports = lazy(() => import('./pages/ReportsRefactored'))
const DressedChickenStock = lazy(() => import('./pages/DressedChickenStockRefactored'))
```

## Benefits of Refactored Versions

### 1. **Smaller, More Maintainable Files**
   - Average file size reduced from ~1,460 lines to ~316 lines
   - Easier to understand and modify
   - Reduced cognitive load for developers

### 2. **Component Reusability**
   - Refactored versions use sub-components from:
     - `src/components/ChickenOrders/`
     - `src/components/LiveChicken/`
     - `src/components/FeedManagement/`
     - `src/components/DressedChicken/`
     - `src/components/Reports/`

### 3. **Better Separation of Concerns**
   - Each sub-component has a single responsibility
   - Forms, lists, analytics, and modals are separated
   - Easier to test individual components

### 4. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Tab-based navigation for better UX
   - Consistent patterns across all pages
   - Shared UI components from `src/components/UI/`

### 5. **Reduced Bug Surface**
   - Less code = fewer places for bugs to hide
   - Smaller components are easier to debug
   - Better error boundaries and loading states

## Architecture Improvements

### Before (Monolithic)
```
ChickenOrders.jsx (1,459 lines)
├── All form logic
├── All table rendering
├── All analytics
├── All customer management
└── All modal handling
```

### After (Modular)
```
ChickenOrdersRefactored.jsx (431 lines)
├── Imports sub-components
├── State management
├── Event handlers
└── Tab navigation

Sub-components:
├── OrderForm.jsx - Form logic
├── OrderList.jsx - Table rendering

├── CustomerManagement.jsx - Customer CRUD
└── BatchUpdateModal.jsx - Bulk operations
```

   - [ ] Delete batch
   - [ ] View health tracking
   - [ ] Check analytics

### 3. **Feed Management** (`/feed`)
   - [ ] Add feed inventory
   - [ ] Record consumption
   - [ ] View analytics
   - [ ] Check low stock alerts

### 4. **Dressed Chicken Stock** (`/dressed-chicken`)

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If any issues are discovered, you can rollback by:

1. Restoring the old files from git history:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/pages/ChickenOrders.jsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/pages/LiveChickenStock.jsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/pages/FeedManagement.jsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/pages/Reports.jsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/pages/DressedChickenStock.jsx
   ```

2. Reverting App.jsx changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/App.jsx
   ```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test all pages** - Verify functionality works as expected
2. ⚠️ **Monitor for errors** - Check browser console for any issues
3. 📝 **Update documentation** - Document any new patterns or conventions
4. 🧪 **Add unit tests** - Test sub-components individually
5. 🎨 **Style consistency** - Ensure CSS is consistent across refactored pages
