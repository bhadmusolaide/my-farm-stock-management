// Test script to verify the connection between lifecycle and dressed chicken stock
console.log('Testing lifecycle to dressed chicken connection...')

// This is a conceptual test - in a real environment, you would:
// 1. Create a chicken batch in the lifecycle tracking page
// 2. Move the batch through the stages until it reaches "Processing"
// 3. Verify that a dressed chicken record is automatically created

console.log('Test steps:')
console.log('1. Create a new chicken batch in the Lifecycle Tracking page')
console.log('2. Move the batch through Arrival -> Brooding -> Growing stages')
console.log('3. Click "Next Stage" when on the Growing stage to move to Processing')
console.log('4. Check the Dressed Chicken Stock page to see if a new record was automatically created')
console.log('5. Check the Processing History tab to see the batch relationship')

console.log('\nExpected behavior:')
console.log('- When moving to the Processing stage, a dressed chicken record should be automatically created')
console.log('- The dressed chicken record should have:')
console.log('  * Same batch_id as the live chicken batch')
console.log('  * Processing date set to today')
console.log('  * Initial and current count matching the live batch count')
console.log('  * Average weight based on the last recorded weight')
console.log('  * Default size category (medium)')
console.log('  * Status set to "in-storage"')
console.log('  * Storage location set to "Freezer Unit A"')
console.log('  * Expiry date set to 3 months from processing date')
console.log('  * Parts count and weight calculated based on batch size')

console.log('\nVerification:')
console.log('Check the Dressed Chicken Stock page to confirm the record was created automatically')
