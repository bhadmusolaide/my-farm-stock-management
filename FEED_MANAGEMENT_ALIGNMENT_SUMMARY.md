# Feed Management UI-Logic Alignment Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to align the Feed Management UI with the backend logic and database schema.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Feed Inventory Form (FeedForm.jsx)

#### Missing Fields Added:
- **`batch_number`**: Required field in database schema but missing from form
  - Auto-generated for new feeds: `FEED-{timestamp}`
  - Read-only for new entries, editable for existing ones
  - Added validation to ensure it's required

- **`cost_per_kg`**: Database field that was missing
  - Auto-calculated from: `(cost_per_bag * number_of_bags) / quantity_kg`
  - Displayed as read-only calculated value in UI
  - Stored in database for accurate cost tracking

- **`status`**: Database field for tracking feed status
  - Default value: `'active'`
  - Options: 'active', 'expired', 'consumed'
  - Properly initialized in form state

- **`balance_deducted`**: Tracking field for balance deduction
  - Boolean flag to prevent duplicate deductions
  - Set to `true` after successful balance deduction

#### Form State Structure (Updated):
```javascript
{
  batch_number: '',          // NEW - Auto-generated or from DB
  feed_type: '',
  brand: '',
  custom_brand: '',
  supplier: '',
  number_of_bags: '',
  quantity_kg: '',
  cost_per_bag: '',
  cost_per_kg: '',          // NEW - Auto-calculated
  purchase_date: '',
  expiry_date: '',
  notes: '',
  status: 'active',         // NEW - Default status
  deduct_from_balance: false,
  balance_deducted: false,  // NEW - Deduction tracking
  assigned_batches: []
}
```

#### Auto-Calculation Logic:
- **Bags to KG**: When `number_of_bags` changes, auto-calculates `quantity_kg`
- **KG to Bags**: When `quantity_kg` changes (and bags is empty), auto-calculates `number_of_bags`
- **Cost per KG**: When `cost_per_bag`, `number_of_bags`, or `quantity_kg` changes:
  ```javascript
  cost_per_kg = (cost_per_bag * number_of_bags) / quantity_kg
  ```

### 2. Feed Consumption Form (FeedConsumptionForm.jsx)

#### Cost Calculation Fixed:
**Before (Incorrect):**
```javascript
const costPerKg = selectedFeed.cost_per_bag / (selectedFeed.quantity_kg / selectedFeed.number_of_bags);
```

**After (Correct):**
```javascript
const costPerKg = selectedFeed.cost_per_kg || 
  (selectedFeed.cost_per_bag * selectedFeed.number_of_bags) / selectedFeed.quantity_kg;
```

#### UI Enhancements:
- Added `batch_number` display in feed details card
- Fixed cost per kg calculation to use stored value or calculate correctly
- Improved feed selection dropdown to show batch number

### 3. Feed Inventory View (FeedInventoryView.jsx)

#### Display Updates:
- Added `batch_number` column as first column
- Updated cost display to show:
  - Cost per bag
  - **Cost per kg** (NEW)
  - Total cost
- Proper calculation fallback for `cost_per_kg` if not in database

### 4. Context Updates (FeedContext.jsx)

#### `addFeedInventory` Function:
- Extracts `assigned_batches` before creating feed item
- Inserts feed inventory to database
- Creates batch assignments in `feed_batch_assignments` table
- Handles errors gracefully (feed creation succeeds even if assignments fail)
- Returns feed item with assignments for local state

#### `updateFeedInventory` Function:
- Extracts `assigned_batches` before updating feed item
- Updates feed inventory in database
- Deletes existing batch assignments
- Creates new batch assignments if provided
- Maintains consistency between feed and assignments

### 5. Feed Management Page (FeedManagementRefactored.jsx)

#### Balance Deduction Logic:
```javascript
if (feedData.deduct_from_balance && !feedData.balance_deducted) {
  const totalCost = feedData.number_of_bags * feedData.cost_per_bag;
  await addExpense(
    totalCost, 
    `Feed purchase: ${feedData.feed_type} - ${feedData.brand} (${feedData.number_of_bags} bags)`
  );
  
  // Mark as deducted to prevent duplicate deductions
  await updateFeedInventory(newFeed.id, {
    ...newFeed,
    balance_deducted: true
  });
}
```

#### Features:
- Only deducts from balance for new feeds (not edits)
- Checks `balance_deducted` flag to prevent duplicate deductions
- Creates expense transaction with descriptive message
- Updates feed record to mark balance as deducted
- Shows appropriate success/warning messages

## Database Schema Alignment

### Feed Inventory Table Fields (All Now Handled):
- ✅ `id` - Primary key
- ✅ `batch_number` - Unique identifier for feed batch
- ✅ `feed_type` - Type of feed (Starter, Grower, Finisher)
- ✅ `brand` - Feed brand
- ✅ `quantity_kg` - Quantity in kilograms
- ✅ `cost_per_kg` - Cost per kilogram (calculated)
- ✅ `cost_per_bag` - Cost per bag
- ✅ `number_of_bags` - Number of bags
- ✅ `purchase_date` - Date of purchase
- ✅ `expiry_date` - Expiry date (optional)
- ✅ `supplier` - Supplier name
- ✅ `status` - Status (active, expired, consumed)
- ✅ `deduct_from_balance` - Whether to deduct from balance
- ✅ `balance_deducted` - Whether balance was deducted
- ✅ `notes` - Additional notes
- ✅ `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- ✅ `updated_at` - Update timestamp

### Feed Batch Assignments Table:
- ✅ `id` - Primary key
- ✅ `feed_id` - Reference to feed_inventory
- ✅ `chicken_batch_id` - Reference to live_chickens
- ✅ `assigned_quantity_kg` - Quantity assigned to batch
- ✅ `assigned_date` - Date of assignment
- ✅ `notes` - Assignment notes
- ✅ `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- ✅ `updated_at` - Update timestamp

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Add New Feed Stock:**
   - Verify batch number is auto-generated
   - Check cost_per_kg is calculated correctly
   - Test balance deduction checkbox functionality
   - Verify batch assignments are saved

2. **Edit Existing Feed:**
   - Ensure batch number is editable
   - Verify cost_per_kg updates when costs change
   - Check that balance is not deducted again on edit

3. **Log Feed Consumption:**
   - Verify cost calculations use correct formula
   - Check batch number displays in feed details
   - Ensure feed inventory is deducted correctly

4. **View Feed Inventory:**
   - Confirm batch number column displays
   - Verify cost per kg shows correctly
   - Check all calculated values are accurate

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/FeedManagement/FeedForm.jsx`
2. `src/components/FeedManagement/FeedConsumptionForm.jsx`
3. `src/components/FeedManagement/FeedInventoryView.jsx`
4. `src/context/FeedContext.jsx`
5. `src/pages/FeedManagementRefactored.jsx`

## Summary

All UI components now properly align with the database schema and backend logic. The form captures all required fields, calculations are accurate, and the data flow from UI → Context → Database is consistent and complete.
