## ‚ùå Forms Requiring Fixes

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Chicken Orders Form (`OrderForm.jsx`)
**Critical Data Integrity Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Fix Required |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Missing `date` field | Orders have no date | Add date field (default: today) |
| Missing `balance` calculation | Incorrect financial tracking | Auto-calculate: `total - amountPaid` |
| Field name mismatch | `amountPaid` vs `amount_paid` | Rename to match DB schema |

**Estimated Impact:** HIGH - Affects financial accuracy and order tracking

---

#### 2. Dressed Chicken Processing Form (`ProcessingForm.jsx`)
**Complex Data Transformation Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Fix Required |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Missing `batch_id` generation | No unique identifier for dressed batches | Auto-generate batch_id |
| Missing `initial_count` & `current_count` | Inventory tracking broken | Set from `processingQuantity` |
| Missing `average_weight` calculation | Weight data not captured | Calculate from live batch |
| Missing `status` field | Status tracking incomplete | Add status field (default: 'in-storage') |
| Parts data structure mismatch | Individual fields vs JSONB | Transform to JSONB before submission |
| Missing `created_by` field | No audit trail | Get from auth context |

**Estimated Impact:** HIGH - Affects inventory accuracy and traceability

---

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 3. Live Chicken Batch Form (`BatchForm.jsx`)
**Feature Completeness Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Fix Required |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Missing lifecycle tracking fields | No stage tracking | Add lifecycle_stage, stage dates |
| No auto-calculation of mortality | Manual calculation required | Auto-calc: `initial_count - current_count` |

**Estimated Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects operational tracking but not critical

---

#### 4. Dressed Chicken Edit Form (`EditForm.jsx`)
**Data Consistency Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Fix Required |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Parts data structure mismatch | Same as ProcessingForm | Transform to JSONB |
| Missing count validation | Can set invalid counts | Validate `current_count <= initial_count` |

**Estimated Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects data quality

---

#### 5. Batch Update Modal (`BatchUpdateModal.jsx`)
**Calculation & Naming Issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Fix Required |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Field name mismatch | `amountPaid` vs `amount_paid` | Rename to match DB |
| Missing balance recalculation | Balance not updated with payment | Recalculate balance on update |
| Incorrect total calculation | Wrong formula in line 35 | Fix: `count √ó size √ó price` |

**Estimated Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects batch operations

## üéì Lessons Learned from Feed Management Fix

### What Worked Well:
1. **Systematic approach** - Compare DB schema ‚Üí Form state ‚Üí Submission logic
2. **Auto-calculation** - Reduces user error and improves UX
3. **Field validation** - Ensures data integrity at form level
4. **Proper data transformation** - Clean separation between UI and DB models

### Best Practices to Apply:
1. Always match field names with database schema (use snake_case)
2. Auto-generate IDs and timestamps in forms
3. Auto-calculate derived fields (balance, totals, etc.)
4. Transform complex data structures before submission
5. Include all database fields in form state (even if hidden)
6. Add proper validation for all required fields
7. Track state changes (like balance_deducted) to prevent duplicates
