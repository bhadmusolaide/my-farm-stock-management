// Test script to verify the persistence fix for dressed chicken records
console.log('Testing dressed chicken persistence fix...')

console.log('Test steps:')
console.log('1. Open the Chicken Lifecycle Tracking page')
console.log('2. Create a new chicken batch')
console.log('3. Move the batch through Arrival -> Brooding -> Growing stages')
console.log('4. Click "Next Stage" when on the Growing stage to move to Processing')
console.log('5. Check the Dressed Chicken Stock page to see if a new record was automatically created')
console.log('6. Refresh the Dressed Chicken Stock page')
console.log('7. Verify that the record still appears after refresh (this was the bug)')

console.log('\nExpected behavior after fix:')
console.log('- When moving to the Processing stage, a dressed chicken record should be automatically created')
console.log('- The dressed chicken record should persist even after refreshing the page')
console.log('- Data should be saved to both Supabase (if available) and localStorage as fallback')

console.log('\nVerification:')
console.log('1. Check browser developer tools -> Application -> Local Storage to see if dressedChickens data is saved')
console.log('2. Check the Dressed Chicken Stock page before and after refresh')
console.log('3. Check that the Processing History tab shows the batch relationship')

console.log('\nTechnical details of the fix:')
console.log('- Added helper functions setDressedChickens and setBatchRelationships that save to localStorage')
console.log('- Updated addDressedChicken, updateDressedChicken, deleteDressedChicken to use these helpers')
console.log('- Updated addBatchRelationship, updateBatchRelationship, deleteBatchRelationship to use helpers')
console.log('- This ensures data persists across page refreshes when Supabase is not available')
